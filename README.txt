Pipeline used to evaluate genetic diversity patterns for five species of groundwater amphipods in Switzerland. These analyses reveal the importance of karstic aquifers for the survival of groundwater macroinvertebrates during the last glacial period. 

This pipeline was used in the article “Genetic structure of peri-alpine groundwater amphipod species suggests persistence under ice cover during late Pleistocene” by Marjorie Couton, Mara Knüsel, Nadine Locher, Roman Alther & Florian Altermatt, submitted for publication in Ecology Letters.

The pipeline can be performed by running the file named "file_to_run.sh". All softwares or R packages and their version number are indicated as comments.

Since the data used in this study were collected in spring catchment boxes used for drinking water collection, the geographical coordinates of the sampling sites is a sensitive information that we do not wish to share in this repository. The coordinates provided in the tables named All_sampling_sites_CH.txt and Metadata_individuals.txt are rounded up to the second decimal and are thus not accurate. The actual coordinates for our sampling sites can, however, be provided upon request.

The barcoding data produced during this study and on which this pipeline was used are stored in ncbi under the Accession numbers XXX to XXX.
